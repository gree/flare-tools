In this document, you can find how to manage a flare cluster with flare-tools.

== Installing flare-tools

Flare-tools isn't published to rubyforge.org, so please pull the code from the repository
and type "rake install_gem" in your shell.

 $ sudo gem install hoe newgem rdoc
 $ git clone ...
 $ cd flare-tools
 $ rake rake install_gem

== Setting up your index server.

First of all, you should setup an index server to create a flare cluster.
You can find debian packages at http://labs.gree.jp/Top/OpenSource/Flare/Download.html .

=== For debian users

If you use flare on debian-based distribution, you can install it using dpkg.

 $ sudo dpkg -i flare_1.0.x-x_i386.deb
 $

You should edit /etc/flared.conf to specify your node name and the index server.
In this tutorial, we assume that the index server is run on the same host where flared 
is running.

 $ vi /etc/flared.conf

 ...
 index-server-name = mynode1
 index-server-port = 12120
 server-name = mynode1
 server-port = 12121
 ...

Now you can start your first flare cluster using flare's init.d script.

 $ sudo /etc/init.d/flare start 

== Checking server status.

 $ flare-admin ping localhost
 alive
